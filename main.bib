  abstract = {As the enrollments in CS courses continue to increase, the need to grade students’ submissions and provide effective feedback promptly at scale is a growing challenge for CS educators. Many autograding solutions have been introduced to address this issue. However, there are multiple barriers to adopting these solutions, including requiring significant changes in a course’s workflow, setup processes requiring extensive IT support, and, more importantly, the learning curve for instructors. These inhibit instructors’ ability to use autograding solutions effectively. In this demo, we present Unison Live, an automated feedback and grading web application that integrates with LTI (learning-tools-interoperability) compliant learning management systems (LMSs) like Canvas. With its use, instructors can enable autograding instructions on their existing assignments in their CS1/2 courses through an intuitive user interface without changing course specifications. Students submit their program files on the LMS and receive instant feedback and grade reports. Unison Live currently supports programming languages like Python, C++, and MATLAB. After the submission deadline, instructors receive auto-generated code similarity reports and aggregate behavioral analytics on student submissions. We believe that an app like this will not only address the logistical issues related to grading but also pedagogically support the integration of formative \& optional programming assignments that students can practice at their own pace and receive feedback. More details on Unison Live are available on https://www.unisonlive.io/},

  abstract = {Refactoring is the practice of improving software quality without altering its external behavior. Developers intuitively refactor their code for multiple purposes, such as improving program comprehension, reducing code complexity, dealing with technical debt, and removing code smells. However, no prior studies have exposed the students to an experience of the process of antipatterns detection and refactoring correction, and provided students with toolset to practice it. To understand and increase the awareness of refactoring concepts, in this paper, we aim to reflect on our experience with teaching refactoring and how it helps students become more aware of bad programming practices and the importance of correcting them via refactoring. This paper discusses the results of an experiment in the classroom that involved carrying out various refactoring activities for the purpose of removing antipatterns using JDeodorant, an IDE plugin that supports antipatterns detection and refactoring. The results of the quantitative and qualitative analysis with 171 students show that students tend to appreciate the idea of learning refactoring and are satisfied with various aspects of the JDeodorant plugin's operation. Through this experiment, refactoring can turn into a vital part of the computing educational plan. We envision our findings enabling educators to support students with refactoring tools tuned towards safer and trustworthy refactoring.},

LLMs such as Codex, GPT-3.5, and GPT 4 have shown promising results in the context of large programming courses, where students can benefit from feedback and hints if provided timely and at scale. This paper explores the quality of GPT-4 Turbo’s generated output for prompts containing both the programming task specification and a student’s submission as input. Two assignments from an introductory programming course were selected, and GPT-4 was asked to generate feedback for 55 randomly chosen, authentic student programming submissions. The output was qualitatively analyzed regarding correctness, personalization, fault localization, and other features identified in the material. Compared to prior work and analyses of GPT-3.5, GPT-4 Turbo shows notable improvements. For example, the output is more structured and consistent. GPT-4 Turbo can also accurately identify invalid casing in student programs’ output. In some cases, the feedback also includes the output of the student program. At the same time, inconsistent feedback was noted such as stating that the submission is correct but an error needs to be fixed. The present work increases our understanding of LLMs’ potential, limitations, and how to integrate them into e-assessment systems, pedagogical scenarios, and instructing students who are using applications based on GPT-4.},

In this paper, we explore the capabilities of an LLM - OpenAI's GPT-3 model to provide feedback for student written code. Specifically, we examine the feasibility of GPT-3 to check, critique and suggest changes to code written by learners in an online programming exam of an undergraduate Python programming course.We collected 1211 student code submissions from 7 questions asked in a programming exam, and provided the GPT-3 model with separate prompts to check, critique and provide suggestions on these submissions. We found that there was a high variability in the accuracy of the model's feedback for student submissions. Across questions, the range for accurately checking the correctness of the code was between 57\% to 79\%, between 41\% to 77\% for accurately critiquing code, and between 32\% and 93\% for suggesting appropriate changes to the code. We also found instances where the model generated incorrect and inconsistent feedback. These findings suggest that models like GPT-3 currently cannot be 'directly' used to provide feedback to students for programming assessments.},

We present the first grounded theory analysis of how programmers interact with Copilot, based on observing 20 participants—with a range of prior experience using the assistant—as they solve diverse programming tasks across four languages. Our main finding is that interactions with programming assistants are bimodal: in acceleration mode, the programmer knows what to do next and uses Copilot to get there faster; in exploration mode, the programmer is unsure how to proceed and uses Copilot to explore their options. Based on our theory, we provide recommendations for improving the usability of future AI programming assistants.},

Hyperstyle supports four programming languages (Python, Java, Kotlin, and Javascript) and can be used as a standalone tool or integrated into a MOOC platform.

  abstract = {People supported by AI-powered decision support tools frequently overrely on the AI: they accept an AI's suggestion even when that suggestion is wrong. Adding explanations to the AI decisions does not appear to reduce the overreliance and some studies suggest that it might even increase it. Informed by the dual-process theory of cognition, we posit that people rarely engage analytically with each individual AI recommendation and explanation, and instead develop general heuristics about whether and when to follow the AI suggestions. Building on prior research on medical decision-making, we designed three cognitive forcing interventions to compel people to engage more thoughtfully with the AI-generated explanations. We conducted an experiment (N=199), in which we compared our three cognitive forcing designs to two simple explainable AI approaches and to a no-AI baseline. The results demonstrate that cognitive forcing significantly reduced overreliance compared to the simple explainable AI approaches. However, there was a trade-off: people assigned the least favorable subjective ratings to the designs that reduced the overreliance the most. To audit our work for intervention-generated inequalities, we investigated whether our interventions benefited equally people with different levels of Need for Cognition (i.e., motivation to engage in effortful mental activities). Our results show that, on average, cognitive forcing interventions benefited participants higher in Need for Cognition more. Our research suggests that human cognitive motivation moderates the effectiveness of explainable AI solutions.},

We believe that the rapid advancements in scientific fields such as machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) opened up opportunities for more scalable approaches. We study the relationship between problem-related entities and functional decomposition. We use an automated system to collect 78,500 code snapshots from two CS1 programming assignments of 250 students and then apply NLP techniques to quantify the learner's ability to break down a problem into a series of smaller, more straightforward tasks. We compare different behaviors and evaluate at scale the impact of decomposition on the time it takes to deliver the solution, its complexity, and the student's performance in the assignment and the course exams. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for teaching and future research.},

While a passing test case may adequately indicate that certain rubric criteria have been met by a student's program, failure can arise from many reasons. When a test case fails due to reasons not previously coded for, it can create confusion. This tends to divert a student's focus from genuine learning towards guessing the test. A more effective approach would be for the system to notify instructors when a test fails, rather than automatically returning a "test case failed'' message. Instructors could then diagnose the cause to provide an initial ''human-in-the-loop'' feedback. Subsequently, this feedback can be coded into the test suite. This method enables the improvement of feedback during an on-going assignment. In this poster, we propose an approach to achieve this objective and introduce a supporting tool.},

This paper reports a qualitative investigation of what educators and students think the purpose of feedback is, and what they think makes feedback effective. We administered a survey on feedback that was completed by 406 staff and 4514 students from two Australian universities. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted on data from a sample of 323 staff with assessment responsibilities and 400 students. Staff and students largely thought the purpose of feedback was improvement. With respect to what makes feedback effective, staff mostly discussed feedback design matters like timing, modalities and connected tasks. In contrast, students mostly wrote that high-quality feedback comments make feedback effective – especially comments that are usable, detailed, considerate of affect and personalised to the student’s own work. This study may assist researchers, educators and academic developers in refocusing their efforts in improving feedback.},

  abstract = {Teacher feedback provided to learners in real-time is a crucial factor for their knowledge and skills acquisition. However, providing real-time feedback at an individual level is often infeasible, considering limited teaching resources. Fortunately, recent technological advancements have allowed for developing of various computer tutoring systems, which can support learners at any place and time by generating personalized feedback automatically. Such systems have emerged in various domains, tackle different educational tasks, and often are designed in very distinctive ways. Consequently, the knowledge in the field of automated feedback systems is rather scattered across different domains and applications, as we illustrate in this study. This paper aims to outline the state-of-the-art of recently developed systems for delivering automated feedback, and thus serves as a source of systematic information for educators, researchers in the educational domain and system developers. More specifically, the contribution of this study is twofold. Firstly, we offer an extensive literature review of the field. As a result of a rigorous selection process, consisting of 4 phases, a total of 109 automated feedback systems is selected for a detailed review and thoroughly classified against numerous dimensions. Secondly, based on a detailed analysis of the recent literature sources and following the design science research approach, a classification framework for automated feedback systems is developed. This framework is used to classify the selected systems, and thus give a detailed overview of the predominantly available educational technologies, the educational settings in which they are applied, the properties of automated feedback they deliver, and the approaches for their design and evaluation. Based on this analysis, several important observations and recommendations are put forward as an outcome of the study. In particular, our study outlines the current fragmentation of the field, discusses a need for a common reference framework, and calls for more personalized, data-driven and student-centered solutions to exploit a larger set of opportunities offered in this age of data.},

We find that the intervention improved mentors' uptake of student contributions by 10\%, reduced their talk time by 5\% and improved student's experience with the program as well as their relative optimism about their academic future.

  abstract = {This paper aims to provide insights into how ChatGPT enhances computer programming education by synthesizing existing studies using rapid review. We analysed 13 articles published in 2023, where studies focused on different aspects of basic programming education. The results indicate that 21\% of these studies demonstrate that ChatGPT served as a tool for code explanation and handling complex topics. However, 36\% show that ChatGPT had difficulty answering non-text-based and code-related questions, revealing reliability and accuracy issues with these tools. Another 36\% of the studies showed that blindly over-reliance on ChatGPT affected critical thinking, student creativity, and problem-solving skills in programming education. 46\% of the studies indicated the need to provide clear guidelines and employ plagiarism-detection tools to instruct students effectively. We suggest that educators should adopt diverse approaches to integrating ChatGPT as an educational tool while highlighting ethical considerations and model limitations.},

  abstract = {The popularity of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as a means of delivering education to large numbers of students has been growing steadily over the last decade. As technology improves, more educational content is becoming readily available to the public. JupyterLab, an open-source web-based interactive development environment (IDE), is also becoming increasingly popular in education, however, it is so far primarily used in small classroom settings. JupyterLab can provide a more interactive, hands-on, and collaborative learning experience for students in MOOCs, and it is highly customizable and can be accessed from anywhere. To capitalize on these benefits, we have developed OpenJupyter, which integrates JupyterLab at scale with MOOCs, enhancing the student learning experience and providing hands-on exercises for data science courses, making them more interactive and engaging. While MOOCs provide access to education for a large number of students, one of the significant challenges is providing effective and timely feedback to learners. OpenJupyter includes an auto-assessment capability that addresses this problem in MOOCs by automating the evaluation process and providing feedback to learners in a timely manner. In this paper, we provide an overview of the architecture of OpenJupyter, its scalability in the context of MOOCs, and its effectiveness in addressing the auto-assessment challenge. We also discuss the Advantages and limitations associated with using OpenJupyter in a MOOC context and provide a reference for educators and researchers who wish to implement similar tools. Our efforts aim to foster an open educational environment in the field of programming by providing learners with an interactive learning tool and a streamlined technical setup, allowing them to acquire and test their knowledge at their own pace.},

  abstract = {Automatic scoring and feedback tools have become critical components of online learning proliferation. These tools range from multiple-choice questions to grading essays using machine learning (ML). Learning environments such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) would not be possible without them. The usage of this mechanism has brought many exciting areas of study, from the design of questions to the ML grading tools’ precision and accuracy. This paper analyzes the findings of 125 studies published in journals and proceedings between 2016 and 2020 on the usages of automatic scoring and feedback as a learning tool. This analysis gives an overview of the trends, challenges, and open questions in this research area. The results indicate that automatic scoring and feedback have many advantages. The most important benefits include enabling scaling the number of students without adding a proportional number of instructors, improving the student experience by reducing the time between submission grading and feedback, and removing bias in scoring. On the other hand, these technologies have some drawbacks. The main problem is creating a disincentive to develop innovative answers that do not match the expected one or have not been considered when preparing the problem. Another drawback is potentially training the student to answer the question instead of learning the concepts. With this, given the existence of a correct answer, such an answer could be leaked to the internet, making it easier for students to avoid solving the problem. Overall, each of these drawbacks presents an opportunity to look at ways to improve technologies to use these tools to provide a better learning experience to students.},

  abstract = {Background and Context: Over the past year, large language models (LLMs) have taken the world by storm. In computing education, like in other walks of life, many opportunities and threats have emerged as a consequence. Objectives: In this article, we explore such opportunities and threats in a specific area: responding to student programmers’ help requests. More specifically, we assess how good LLMs are at identifying issues in problematic code that students request help on. Method: We collected a sample of help requests and code from an online programming course. We then prompted two different LLMs (OpenAI Codex and GPT-3.5) to identify and explain the issues in the students’ code and assessed the LLM-generated answers both quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings: GPT-3.5 outperforms Codex in most respects. Both LLMs frequently find at least one actual issue in each student program (GPT-3.5 in 90\% of the cases). Neither LLM excels at finding all the issues (GPT-3.5 finding them 57\% of the time). False positives are common (40\% chance for GPT-3.5). The advice that the LLMs provide on the issues is often sensible. The LLMs perform better on issues involving program logic rather than on output formatting. Model solutions are frequently provided even when the LLM is prompted not to. LLM responses to prompts in a non-English language are only slightly worse than responses to English prompts. Implications: Our results continue to highlight the utility of LLMs in programming education. At the same time, the results highlight the unreliability of LLMs: LLMs make some of the same mistakes that students do, perhaps especially when formatting output as required by automated assessment systems. Our study informs teachers interested in using LLMs as well as future efforts to customize LLMs for the needs of programming education.},

However, student and educator dissatisfaction with feedback practices continues to remain a significant problem in higher education. To better understand the barriers to effective feedback, the present study explores feedback challenges identified by 3807 students and 281 educators from two Australian universities. Open-response data were analysed using an inductively derived coding framework and thematic analysis. The findings reveal three major themes relating to the challenges of feedback from the perspective of students and educators: feedback practices, contextual constraints and individual capacity. In addition to confirming the persistence of many previously reported challenges in the literature, this paper also offers insights into challenges that are particular to feedback, especially relating to the production of useful comments and the perceived hurdles of both student and educator attitudes and capabilities. The findings also highlight the constrained nature of educators’ work, particularly in relation to time. While further research is needed, we propose that feedback needs to be understood as an interaction between practices, context and individuals.},

In educational contexts, feedback enriches students' learning and work quality through reflection. However, providing effective feedback at scale is challenging. Students struggle to engage with feedback, often due to lack of feedback literacy. Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing, a branch of Artificial Intelligence, provides opportunities to evaluate how we can support feedback providers in its quality and scale. This poster paper presents an overview of key feedback challenges, attributes of high quality feedback, and introduces the Intelligent Feedback Assistant (IFA), an innovative NLP-based system designed to assist educators in delivering high-quality feedback. IFA operates as an ensemble of machine learning models and non-AI systems to guide educators in refining their feedback, ensuring it embodies attributes of effective feedback - actionable, specific, justified, and positive. IFA is supportive, not generative, ensuring the feedback provider remains central to the feedback provision process. The tool design, and outcomes of IFA offers a promising path for scaleable, high-quality formative feedback in education and beyond.},

Learners worked on 45 Python code-authoring tasks, for which half of the learners had access to Codex, each followed by a code-modification task. Our results show that using Codex significantly increased code-authoring performance (1.15x increased completion rate and 1.8x higher scores) while not decreasing performance on manual code-modification tasks. Additionally, learners with access to Codex during the training phase performed slightly better on the evaluation post-tests conducted one week later, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Of interest, learners with higher Scratch pre-test scores performed significantly better on retention post-tests, if they had prior access to Codex.},

We present the results of a thematic analysis on a data set from 33 learners, aged 10-17, as they independently learned Python by working on 45 code-authoring tasks with access to an AI Code Generator based on OpenAI Codex. We explore several important questions related to how learners used LLM-based AI code generators, and provide an analysis of the properties of the written prompts and the resulting AI generated code. Specifically, we explore (A) the context in which learners use Codex, (B) what learners are asking from Codex in terms of syntax and logic, (C) properties of prompts written by learners in terms of relation to task description, language, clarity, and prompt crafting patterns, (D) properties of the AI-generated code in terms of correctness, complexity, and accuracy, and (E) how learners utilize AI-generated code in terms of placement, verification, and manual modifications. Furthermore, our analysis reveals four distinct coding approaches when writing code with an AI code generator: AI Single Prompt, where learners prompted Codex once to generate the entire solution to a task; AI Step-by-Step, where learners divided the problem into parts and used Codex to generate each part; Hybrid, where learners wrote some of the code themselves and used Codex to generate others; and Manual coding, where learners wrote the code themselves. Our findings reveal consistently positive trends between learners’ utilization of the Hybrid coding approach and their post-test evaluation scores, while showing consistent negative trends between the AI Single Prompt and the post-test evaluation scores. Furthermore, we offer insights into novice learners’ use of AI code generators in a self-paced learning environment, highlighting signs of over-reliance, self-regulation, and opportunities for enhancing AI-assisted learning tools.},

In particular, we aim at (1) exploring how an LLM like ChatGPT responds to students seeking help with their introductory programming tasks, and (2) identifying feedback types in its responses. To achieve these goals, we used students' programming sequences from a dataset gathered within a CS1 course as input for ChatGPT along with questions required to elicit feedback and correct solutions. The results show that ChatGPT performs reasonably well for some of the introductory programming tasks and student errors, which means that students can potentially benefit. However, educators should provide guidance on how to use the provided feedback, as it can contain misleading information for novices.},

It is a timeconsuming and labor-intensive task for instructors, especially when the grading criteria are subjective and constantly evolving. Rubrics are often used to standardize grading, but they can be challenging to create and may not always capture the nuances of a particular assignment. Additionally, it can be difficult to articulate principles or constraints that define a "good" solution in less well-defined domains; like human-computer interaction (HCI) [3, 8] or user experience (UX) [7]. Instructors may delegate the task of grading and offering feedback to a number of graders. However, through our co-design study (section 2.1), we've found that inter-grader reliability, managing time constraints, and dealing with unclear rubrics are just some of the many issues faced by graders in this process.},

  abstract = {Existing research does not quantify and compare the differences between automated and manual assessment in the context of feedback on programming assignments. This makes it hard to reason about the effects of adopting automated assessment at the expense of manual assessment. Based on a controlled experiment involving N=117 undergraduate first-semester CS1 students, we compare the effects of having access to feedback from: i) only automated assessment, ii) only manual assessment (in the form of teaching assistants), and iii) both automated as well as manual assessment. The three conditions are compared in terms of (objective) task effectiveness and from a (subjective) student perspective. The experiment demonstrates that having access to both forms of assessment (automated and manual) is superior both from a task effectiveness as well as a student perspective. We also find that the two forms of assessment are complementary: automated assessment appears to be better in terms of task effectiveness; whereas manual assessment appears to be better from a student perspective. Further, we found that automated assessment appears to be working better for men than women, who are significantly more inclined towards manual assessment. We then perform a cost/benefit analysis which leads to the identification of four equilibria that appropriately balance costs and benefits. Finally, this gives rise to four recommendations of when to use which kind or combination of feedback (manual and/or automated), depending on the number of students and the amount of per-student resources available. These observations provide educators with evidence-based justification for budget requests and considerations on when to (not) use automated assessment.},

  abstract = {This study highlights the potential of fine-tuned ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) for automatically scoring student written constructed responses using example assessment tasks in science education. Recent studies on OpenAI's generative model GPT-3.5 proved its superiority in predicting the natural language with high accuracy and human-like responses. GPT-3.5 has been trained over enormous online language materials such as journals and Wikipedia; therefore, more than direct usage of pre-trained GPT-3.5 is required for automatic scoring as students utilize a different language than trained material. These imply that a domain-specific model, fine-tuned over data for specific tasks, can enhance model performance. In this study, we fine-tuned GPT-3.5 on six assessment tasks with a diverse dataset of middle-school and high-school student responses and expert scoring. The six tasks comprise two multi-label and four multi-class assessment tasks. We compare the performance of fine-tuned GPT-3.5 with the fine-tuned state-of-the-art Google's generated language model, BERT. The results show that in-domain training corpora constructed from science questions and responses for BERT achieved average accuracy = 0.838, SD = 0.069. GPT-3.5 shows a remarkable average increase (9.1\%) in automatic scoring accuracy (mean = 9.15, SD = 0.042) for the six tasks, p =0.001 \&lt; 0.05. Specifically, for multi-label tasks (item 1 with 5 labels; item 2 with 10 labels), GPT-3.5 achieved significantly higher scoring accuracy than BERT across all the labels, with the second item achieving a 7.1\% increase. The average scoring increase for the four multi-class items for GPT-3.5 was 10.6\% compared to BERT. Our study confirmed the effectiveness of fine-tuned GPT-3.5 for automatic scoring of student responses on domain-specific data in education with high accuracy. We have released fine-tuned models for public use and community engagement.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the application of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with Chain-of-Though (CoT) in the automatic scoring of student-written responses to science assessments. We focused on overcoming the challenges of accessibility, technical complexity, and lack of explainability that have previously limited the use of artificial intelligence-based automatic scoring tools among researchers and educators. With a testing dataset comprising six assessment tasks (three binomial and three trinomial) with 1,650 student responses, we employed six prompt engineering strategies to automatically score student responses. The six strategies combined zero-shot or few-shot learning with CoT, either alone or alongside item stem and scoring rubrics. Results indicated that few-shot (acc = .67) outperformed zero-shot learning (acc = .60), with 12.6\% increase. CoT, when used without item stem and scoring rubrics, did not significantly affect scoring accuracy (acc = .60). However, CoT prompting paired with contextual item stems and rubrics proved to be a significant contributor to scoring accuracy (13.44\% increase for zero-shot; 3.7\% increase for few-shot). We found a more balanced accuracy across different proficiency categories when CoT was used with a scoring rubric, highlighting the importance of domain-specific reasoning in enhancing the effectiveness of LLMs in scoring tasks. We also found that GPT-4 demonstrated superior performance over GPT -3.5 in various scoring tasks when combined with the single-call greedy sampling or ensemble voting nucleus sampling strategy, showing 8.64\% difference. Particularly, the single-call greedy sampling strategy with GPT-4 outperformed other approaches.},

  abstract = {How students are assessed has a powerful effect on their strategies for studying and their learning. When designing assessments, instructors should consider how different approaches for providing feedback to students could encourage positive learning behaviours. One such design is the use of interim deadlines that enable students to receive and respond to feedback. This is used to encourage students to start early and thus reduce the negative effects of procrastination. If multiple submissions are allowed, penalty schemes can be included to encourage students to reflect deeply on the feedback they receive, rather than developing an over-reliance on autograders. In this work we describe two approaches to feedback used over two consecutive semesters for a final project in a large introductory programming course. In both semesters, the complexity and structure of the final project was similar and students received identical instruction. In the first instance of the course students could submit their work prior to two scheduled interim deadlines, after which they would receive automated feedback, before meeting a final third deadline. In the second instance, students received automated feedback immediately upon submission but with increasing penalties to discourage excessive submissions. In both cases, the ability to receive automated feedback -- both scheduled and immediate -- was designed to encourage early participation with the project. Under the two feedback schemes, we observed different patterns of behaviour -- particularly for the lower performing students. We explore the benefits and drawbacks of the two schemes and consider implications for future project grading.},

One factor in this challenge is that the messages are typically intended for an audience that already knows how to program, or even for programming environments that then use the information to highlight areas in code. Researchers have been working on making these errors more novice friendly since the 1960s, however progress has been slow. The present work contributes to this stream of research by using large language models to enhance programming error messages with explanations of the errors and suggestions on how to fix them. Large language models can be used to create useful and novice-friendly enhancements to programming error messages that sometimes surpass the original programming error messages in interpretability and actionability. These results provide further evidence of the benefits of large language models for computing educators, highlighting their use in areas known to be challenging for students. We further discuss the benefits and downsides of large language models and highlight future streams of research for enhancing programming error messages.},

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged recently and show great promise for providing on-demand help at a large scale, but there are concerns that students may over-rely on the outputs produced by these models. In this paper, we introduce CodeHelp, a novel LLM-powered tool designed with guardrails to provide on-demand assistance to programming students without directly revealing solutions. We detail the design of the tool, which incorporates a number of useful features for instructors, and elaborate on the pipeline of prompting strategies we use to ensure generated outputs are suitable for students. To evaluate CodeHelp, we deployed it in a first-year computer and data science course with 52 students and collected student interactions over a 12-week period. We examine students’ usage patterns and perceptions of the tool, and we report reflections from the course instructor and a series of recommendations for classroom use. Our findings suggest that CodeHelp is well-received by students who especially value its availability and help with resolving errors, and that for instructors it is easy to deploy and complements, rather than replaces, the support that they provide to students.},

We plan to share our journey and offer insights into responsibly harnessing AI in educational settings. Participants will gain hands-on experience working with GPT through OpenAI's APIs, understanding and crafting prompts, answering questions using embedding-based search, and finally, building their own AI chatbot. Ultimately, we'll not only share lessons learned from our own approach but also equip educators hands-on with the knowledge and tools with which they, too, can implement these technologies in their unique teaching environments.},

These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had "a personal tutor.'' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course's discussion forum. Additionally, we present our methodological approach, implementation details, and guidance for those considering using these tools or AI generally in education.},

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of employing GPT-3.5 from OpenAI, as an LLM teaching assistant (TA) or a virtual TA in computer science (CS) courses. The objective is to enhance the accessibility of CS education while maintaining academic integrity by refraining from providing direct solutions to current-semester assignments. Targeting Foundations of Programming (COMP202), an undergraduate course that introduces students to programming with Python, we have developed a virtual TA using the LangChain framework, known for integrating language models with diverse data sources and environments. The virtual TA assists students with their code and clarifies complex concepts. For homework questions, it is designed to guide students with hints rather than giving out direct solutions. We assessed its performance first through a qualitative evaluation, then a survey-based comparative analysis, using a mix of questions commonly asked on the COMP202 discussion board and questions created by the authors. Our preliminary results indicate that the virtual TA outperforms human TAs on clarity and engagement, matching them on accuracy when the question is non-assignment-specific, for which human TAs still proved more reliable. These findings suggest that while virtual TAs, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, hold great promise towards making CS education experience more accessible and engaging, their optimal use necessitates human supervision. We conclude by identifying several directions that could be explored in future implementations.},

We evaluate a Python implementation of the algorithm by comparing its output at different stages of the algorithm to state-of-the-art systems with similar goals. Our algorithm outperforms existing systems that can analyze and fix beginner-written Python code. Further, fixes it generates conform very well to corrections written by human experts for an existing benchmark of code correction quality.},

While some research has examined the impact of feedback on student learning in programming, there is no work (to our knowledge) that examines the impact of adaptive immediate feedback within programming environments on students' desire to persist in computer science (CS). In this paper, we integrate an adaptive immediate feedback (AIF) system into a block-based programming environment. Our AIF system is novel because it provides personalized positive and corrective feedback to students in real time as they work. In a controlled pilot study with novice high-school programmers, we show that our AIF system significantly increased students' intentions to persist in CS, and that students using AIF had greater engagement (as measured by their lower idle time) compared to students in the control condition. Further, we found evidence that the AIF system may improve student learning, as measured by student performance in a subsequent task without AIF. In interviews, students found the system fun and helpful, and reported feeling more focused and engaged. We hope this paper spurs more research on adaptive immediate feedback and the impact of programming environments on students' intentions to persist in CS.},

We prompted the model with example feedback (few-shot learning) and instruction to (1) give feedback on conceptual understanding, syntax, and time complexity, and (2) suggest follow-up actions based on students' code or provide guiding questions. Overall, GPT-4 provided accurate feedback and successfully built on students' ideas in most submissions. Human evaluators (computer science instructors and tutors) rated GPT-4's hints as useful in guiding students' next steps.

  abstract = {Practical programming competencies are critical to the success in computer science (CS) education and go-to-market of fresh graduates. Acquiring the required level of skills is a long journey of discovery, trial and error, and optimization seeking through a broad range of programming activities that learners must perform themselves. It is not reasonable to consider that teachers could evaluate all attempts that the average learner should develop multiplied by the number of students enrolled in a course, much less in a timely, deep, and fair fashion. Unsurprisingly, exploring the formal structure of programs to automate the assessment of certain features has long been a hot topic among CS education practitioners. Assessing a program is considerably more complex than asserting its functional correctness, as the proliferation of tools and techniques in the literature over the past decades indicates. Program efficiency, behavior, and readability, among many other features, assessed either statically or dynamically, are now also relevant for automatic evaluation. The outcome of an evaluation evolved from the primordial Boolean values to information about errors and tips on how to advance, possibly taking into account similar solutions. This work surveys the state of the art in the automated assessment of CS assignments, focusing on the supported types of exercises, security measures adopted, testing techniques used, type of feedback produced, and the information they offer the teacher to understand and optimize learning. A new era of automated assessment, capitalizing on static analysis techniques and containerization, has been identified. Furthermore, this review presents several other findings from the conducted review, discusses the current challenges of the field, and proposes some future research directions.},

  abstract = {Research on programming education shows that novice programming students benefit significantly from one-to-one tutoring. While many systems propose to replicate the effectiveness of one-to-one tutoring in large-scale classes, it remains a challenge to develop systems with an approach to finding students who need the tutors' help the most. In this paper, we explore the idea of predicting the priority of students in need with a data-driven approach. Among various metrics to calculate the priority of students in need, we adopt time-on-task metric. Previous studies have found that excessively long time-on-task can be used as an indication of students' struggling. Aligned with this, we reduce the problem of finding students with the highest priority to the problem of finding students with the longest time-on-task. To solve the reduced problem, we present EliRank, a ranking model that finds students with the longest estimated time-on-task, using the students' first few minutes of fine-grained code editing history. EliRank recommends students in the descending order of estimated time-on-task, enabling tutors to efficiently monitor and find the students in need at scale in real time. To evaluate the performance of EliRank, we build and publish a new real-world dataset consisting of 15 programming exercises solved by 4000+ students in an introduction to programming class at a university. Unlike the currently available open code editing history datasets, our dataset contains code editing operations at a character-level granularity to minimize the loss of contextual information from students. We also introduce diff-augmented abstract syntax tree (DAST), a novel structured code representation that minimizes the loss of fine-grained code change information during code parsing. The evaluation of EliRank on our dataset shows that EliRank effectively finds students with the longest estimated time-on-task, for early detection of students in need. Also, we illustrate in depth (i) the effectiveness of DAST, (ii) the potential to control the tradeoff between early detection and the prediction accuracy of the model, and (iii) the transferability to unseen programming exercise via zero-shot transfer learning.},

  abstract = {Personalized learning stems from the idea that students benefit from instructional material tailored to their needs. Many online learning platforms purport to implement some form of personalized learning, often through on-demand tutoring or self-paced instruction, but to our knowledge none have a way to automatically explore for specific opportunities to personalize students' education nor a transparent way to identify the effects of personalization on specific groups of students. In this work we present the Automatic Personalized Learning Service (APLS). The APLS uses multi-armed bandit algorithms to recommend the most effective support to each student that requests assistance when completing their online work, and is currently used by ASSISTments, an online learning platform. The first empirical study of the APLS found that Beta-Bernoulli Thompson Sampling, a popular and effective multi-armed bandit algorithm, was only slightly more capable of selecting helpful support than randomly selecting from the relevant support options. Therefore, we also present Decision Tree Thompson Sampling (DTTS), a novel contextual multi-armed bandit algorithm that integrates the transparency and interpretability of decision trees into Thomson sampling. In simulation, DTTS overcame the challenges of recommending support within an online learning platform and was able to increase students' learning by as much as 10\% more than the current algorithm used by the APLS. We demonstrate that DTTS is able to identify qualitative interactions that not only help determine the most effective support for students, but that also generalize well to new students, problems, and support content. The APLS using DTTS is now being deployed at scale within ASSISTments and is a promising tool for all educational learning platforms.},

It provides learners with a comparison of their performance to educational goals with the aim of helping them achieve or exceed their goals. Effective feedback is delivered in an appropriate setting, focusses on performance and not the individual, is specific, is based on direct observation or objective date, is delivered using neutral, non-judgemental language and identifies actions or plans for improvement. For best results, the sender and receiver of feedback must work as allies. Negative feedback can create an emotional response in the learner, which may interfere with the effectiveness of the feedback due to dissonance between self-evaluation and external appraisal. Reflection can help learners process negative feedback and allow them to develop and implement improvement plans. Both delivering and receiving feedback are skills that can be improved with training. Teachers have a duty to provide meaningful feedback to learners; learners should expect feedback and seek it.},

According to researchers, formative feedback should be nonevaluative, supportive, timely, and specific. Formative feedback is usually presented as information to a learner in response to some action on the learner’s part. It comes in a variety of types (e.g., verification of response accuracy, explanation of the correct answer, hints, worked examples) and can be administered at various times during the learning process (e.g., immediately following an answer, after some time has elapsed). Finally, several variables have been shown to interact with formative feedback’s success at promoting learning (e.g., individual characteristics of the learner and aspects of the task). All of these issues are discussed. This review concludes with guidelines for generating formative feedback.},

This paper presents and evaluates the dcc --help tool, an integration of a Large Language Model (LLM) into the Debugging C Compiler (DCC) to generate unique, novice-focused explanations tailored to each error. dcc --help prompts an LLM with contextual information of compile- and run-time error occurrences, including the source code, error location and standard compiler error message. The LLM is instructed to generate novice-focused, actionable error explanations and guidance, designed to help students understand and resolve problems without providing solutions. dcc --help was deployed to our CS1 and CS2 courses, with 2,565 students using the tool over 64,000 times in ten weeks. We analysed a subset of these error/explanation pairs to evaluate their properties, including conceptual correctness, relevancy, and overall quality. We found that the LLM-generated explanations were conceptually accurate in 90\% of compile-time and 75\% of run-time cases, but often disregarded the instruction not to provide solutions in code. Our findings, observations and reflections following deployment indicate that dcc-help provides novel opportunities for scaffolding students' introduction to programming.},

  abstract = {Code quality and maintainability are among under-emphasized and often neglected topics in the curriculum of software engineering (SE) in higher education. This neglect tends to overlook research findings that demonstrate SE students' programming submissions most often exhibit severe code quality issues, which are frequently left unaddressed by the students. Furthermore, it can result in the software engineering curriculum becoming indifferent to the essential requirements of the software development industry, where code quality and maintainability play a crucial role in the software's cost throughout its life cycle.Therefore, SE students in higher education should be trained to master the knowledge and skills of writing high-quality code. One possible approach to improving students' understanding of code quality issues is to provide automatically generated formative feedback about the code quality aspects of their programming submissions throughout the code development process. However, while there are tools available for generating automated feedback on the code quality aspects of programming submissions, they often lack a set of theory-driven design principles to underpin the content and presentation of their provided feedback. This lack of theoretical foundation makes it difficult to follow a systematic approach to designing and developing such tools, reasoning about their quality, and evaluating the effectiveness of their generated feedback.To address this lack, this study provides nine contextualized design principles for generating automated formative feedback on code quality. These design principles are rooted in solid educational constructs about feedback and learning dashboards, and empirically validated and contextualized by two focus group sessions consisting of 8 senior SE students and 2 teachers.This approach has resulted in a set of contextualized design principles. These design principles can be used to guide the implementation of tools that provide automated feedback on code quality using software metrics.},

  abstract = {Generative AI, notably ChatGPT, has garnered attention in computer science education. This paper presents a controlled experiment that explores ChatGPT's role in CS1 in a classroom setting. Specifically, we aim to investigate the impact of ChatGPT on student learning outcomes and their behaviors when working on programming assignments. Participants were tasked with creating a UML diagram and subsequently implementing its design through programming, followed by a closed-book post-evaluation and a post-survey. All the participants were required to screen-record the whole process. In total, 56 participants were recruited, with 48 successful screen recordings. Participants in the Experimental Group can access ChatGPT 3.5 and other online resources, such as Google and Stack Overflow when creating the UML diagram and programming; however, participants in the Control Group can access all online resources except for ChatGPT (i.e., the only design variable is the access to ChatGPT). Finally, we measured and analyzed participants' learning outcomes through their UML diagram, programming, and post-evaluation scores. We also analyzed the time participants took to complete the tasks and their interactions with ChatGPT and other resources from the screen recordings. After finishing the tasks, student participants also provided their perceptions of using ChatGPT in CS1 through a post-survey.With rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that (1) using ChatGPT does not present a significant impact on students' learning performance in the CS1 assignment-style tasks; (2) once using ChatGPT, students' tendency to explore other traditional educational resources is largely reduced (though available) and they tend to rely solely on ChatGPT, and this reliance on ChatGPT did not guarantee enhanced learning performance; (3) the majority of students hold neutral views on ChatGPT's role in CS1 programming but most of them raised concerns about its potential ethical issues and inconsistent performance across different tasks. We hope this study can help educators and students better understand the impact of ChatGPT in CS1 and inspire future work to provide proper guidelines for using ChatGPT in introductory programming classes.},

Unfortunately, providing custom repairs for these mistakes can require a substantial amount of time and effort from class instructors. Automated program repair (APR) techniques can be used to synthesize such fixes. Prior work has explored the use of symbolic and neural techniques for APR in the education domain. Both types of approaches require either substantial engineering efforts or large amounts of data and training. We propose to use a large language model trained on code, such as Codex (a version of GPT), to build an APR system -- PyDex -- for introductory Python programming assignments. Our system can fix both syntactic and semantic mistakes by combining multi-modal prompts, iterative querying, test-case-based selection of few-shots, and program chunking. We evaluate PyDex on 286 real student programs and compare to three baselines, including one that combines a state-of-the-art Python syntax repair engine, BIFI, and a state-of-the-art Python semantic repair engine for student assignments, Refactory. We find that PyDex can fix more programs and produce smaller patches on average.},
